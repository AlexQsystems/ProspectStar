## Summary Comparison

### Compliance Table

| Template | Subject | Hook | Value | Proof | CTA | Signature | Score |
|----------|---------|------|-------|-------|-----|-----------|--------|
| STANDARD | ✅ | ❌52w | ✅ | ❌63w | ❌22w | ✅ | 3/5 (60%) |
| CONCISE | ✅ | ✅26w | ✅ | N/A | ❌24w | ✅ | 4/5 (80%) |
| PAIN-POINT | ✅ | ✅28w | ✅ | ✅29w | ❌20w | ✅ | 4/5 (80%) |
| SOCIAL-PROOF | ✅ | ✅27w | ✅ | N/A | ❌23w | ✅ | 4/5 (80%) |
| THOUGHT-LEAD | ✅ | ✅32w | ✅ | ✅20w | ❌17w | ✅ | 4/5 (80%) |

### CTA Violations - The Universal Problem

| Template | CTA Words | Limit | Violation |
|----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| STANDARD | 22 | 12 | +83% |
| **CONCISE** | **24** | 12 | **+100%** |
| PAIN-POINT | 20 | 12 | +67% |
| SOCIAL-PROOF | 23 | 12 | +92% |
| THOUGHT-LEAD | 17 | 12 | +42% |

### Key Findings

1. **100% CTA Failure Rate**: Every template violates the 12-word CTA limit

2. **CONCISE Paradox**: Has the LONGEST CTA (24 words) despite being the "concise" template

3. **STANDARD Most Verbose**: Only template failing multiple elements (Hook, Proof, CTA)

4. **Missing Differentiation**: Templates have similar structures despite different names


---

## Conclusion

While all templates successfully include required structural elements, the universal CTA violation (100% failure rate) indicates a systematic issue with the AI's understanding of length constraints. The system prioritizes completeness over conciseness, particularly problematic for the CONCISE template which should exemplify brevity.
