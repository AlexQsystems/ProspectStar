## üéØ KEY FINDINGS

### ‚úÖ WHAT WORKS WELL:

1. **IRRELEVANT FILTERING: 100%**
   - NO template mentioned COFFEE_MACHINE, OFFICE_PLANTS, PINGPONG, RAINBOW, TACOS, YOGA
   - Filtering works both within and across tables

2. **CONCEPTUAL USAGE: 40-70%**
   - AI understands connection between facts and offering
   - Uses concepts (HR problems, data challenges, manual processes)

### ‚ùå  ISSUES:

1. **LOSS OF SPECIFICITY: 100%**
   - NO specific numbers used (500, 80%, $8.2B, 47%, 18 months)
   - "500 employees manually" ‚Üí "manual processes"
   - "$75M lost" ‚Üí "costly setbacks"
   - "PETABYTES" ‚Üí "vast data"

2. **DATA FABRICATION**
   - Standard: fabricated "70% reduction"
   - Social-proof: fabricated "30% cost reduction"
   

3. **TEMPLATE MISALIGNMENT**
   - Pain-point doesn't emphasize pain (softest tone)
   - Concise isn't the shortest (1301 characters)
   - Thought-leadership doesn't use market data

### üìà KEY METRICS:

- **Average generation time**: 17.5 seconds
- **Irrelevant filtering**: 100% (excellent)
- **Relevant fact usage**: ~50% (poor)
- **Specific number usage**: 0% (critical)
- **Fabrication risk**: exists

---

## üí° Thoughts to discuss

1. Fix fabricated metrics generation
2. Add usage of specific numbers from database
3. Strengthen differences between templates
4. Should Pain-point  use emotional markers (like crisis, drowning)?

---

## üî¥ Summary


- ‚úÖ Filtering works excellently
- ‚ùå Content too generic
- ‚ùå Loses specificity and detail
- ‚ùå Some risk of generating false data

**Best template**: CONCISE (75/100) - only one that directly references sources
**Worst template**: THOUGHT-LEADERSHIP (50/100) - most general and uninformative
